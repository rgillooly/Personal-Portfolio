        Most of my charity work is somewhat minor, I have done miscelaneous bits of charity work in conjunction with my church,
         but this ramped up when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. We have since marched in the Relay for Life, a cancer 
         fundraiser and walkathon. Unfortunately my grandmother lost her battle with cancer, but to paraphrase the words of Norm Macdonald,
          "When you die of cancer, the cancer dies too. That to me is not a loss, it is a draw." I couldn't agree more.
