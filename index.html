    <p>
        I was born in the year 1998 in New Jersey. I then attended school (until first grade) in Somerset, NJ. We then moved to Hillsborough.
         I continued to attend school until I graduated from Hillsborough High School. This led me to enroll in Fairleigh Dickinson University's Film Program.
         It took me six years to graduate. However, I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor's of Arts. This is me on paper, but I would like to tell you about who I really am.
         I am an artist at heart, but this doesn't mean I am not skilled in technical respects. I have always excelled at math and science.
         This is what led me to study a subject I am passionate about, film. I found out a hard truth after my education, however: the film industry is hard to break into.
         Even with the contact that i had made through school, I still could not get more than one gig, in one year. This led me to branch out.
         I began to research coding, and found lots of online resources. One of my first web development projects was a website for my family's
         business. You can see this at www.marinerpropertiesrental.com. I am now a freelance web developer and am looking for more projects.
