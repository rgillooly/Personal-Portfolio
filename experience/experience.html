        Here I will outline my work experience in chronological order.

        My first job was at our family business, Mariner Properties. Here I would help turnover the properties we rent between tenants. This would involve doing 
        a sweep of the properties to see if there was anything broken. Then we would set about repairing anything that was in disrepair. This usually started with 
        new batteries for smoke detectors and new lightbulbs where needed. We would also let in a cleaning service to do a final clean.

        My second job was at Integra Realty Resources, which later became a Newmark Knight Frank office. I was a data entry clerk, and property researcher.
        I reasearched properties which were comparables of our subject property. This way we could appraise the property accurately. I also would enter them
        into the database. Finally, I also would sometimes be sent out to take pictures of said properties.

        My next job was helping with a school project. This involved making a promotional video for a local hospital - Morristown Medical Center. They have a 
        nonprofit channel where the children in the hospital can hear a storybook read out. This channel was called "Calling All Kids". We volunteered to help 
        them with our expertise in the film program. We made a video to show to potential donors to raise awareness of the needs of the channel.

        My next job was in the bakery of a Shoprite supermarket. Here, I would prep the dough and other frozen goods for baking. This involved taking the dough
        and placing it in a certain arrangement on a tray. These arrangements were based on the product and were meant for maximum efficiency. I then would take the 
        trays and place them on a rack. This rack would be placed in the fridge so the dough would thaw but now spoil.

        By this time, I had reached my senior year of college. This led to the senior thesis projects, the culmination of our college film careers. We had the option 
        to either make our own films, or work on two other films. I elected to work on the films of others. This led me to the films "Sailing Through Rough Waters" and 
        "The Good and the Virtuous". The former film was about the journey of a young girl addicted to drugs. The latter was about a boy who's family was involved in 
        organized crime, and his journey into, and eventually out of, that world. I served as the sound department for both, as well as a production assistant on "The Good and the Virtuous".

        Now, out of college, I began working in the film industry. After some time, I found my first gig with Warner Brothers on a then upcoming show: "The Girls on the Bus".
         I served as a production assistant in the COVID-19 compliance department. I made sure members of cast and crew were properly observing masking and other health regulations.
          This was a highly informative experience. I loved the job.

        After my gig with Warner Brothers, I fell into a dry spell. Breaking into the film industry is hard, and with strikes raging in Hollywood the difficulties were amplified. So, I 
        looked to put my expertise to other avenues. I had been researching coding passively as a hobby, but I began to become more and more serious about the subject. With online resources I was able to get far.
         However I sought formal training. I enrolled into a coding boot camp. With what I learned, I was soon able to develop entire websites solo. This led me to make the lives of my family 
         easier, by making my first website. I made a website for my family's business. This was a way to reduce the number of trips my family needed to make to meet tenants and pass them paperwork.
